# Utilities
This is a library of utility functions, data structures, and other misc classes. Please do me a favor and don't use these in any production system in any way.
These are intended as a replacement for the Framework Class Library classes and I'm mostly coding them for assistance in programming problems or other personal
use where strict speed is the only factor and usability, security, and error handling are not relevant at all.
